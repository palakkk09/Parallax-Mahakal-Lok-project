      <h2>The only three words on every ujjaini's tongue are : JAI SHREE MAHAKAL</h2>
      <p>
        Lord Shiva is often referred to as Mahakal - The one beyond time and death. Because Lord Shiva is believed to 
        be existing before the beginning of time, he is called Mahakaal. Another name for this characteristic is Kalateet,
        which literally means beyond the frets of time. Kaal in simple terms also means death. Lord Shiva is beyond the 
        birth and death cycle and therefore known with this name. A local legend says that there once was a king called
        Chandrasena who ruled Ujjain and was a Shiva devotee. The Lord appeared in his Mahakal form and destroyed his enemies.
        Upon the request of his devotees, Shiva agreed to reside in the city and become its chief deity. The Mahakal dominates the 
        life of the city and its people, even in the midst of the busy routine of modern preoccupations, and provides an unbreakable 
        link with ancient Hindu traditions. On the day of Maha Shivaratri, a huge fair is held near the temple, and worship goes on through the night.
